                                        DEVELOPMENT OF A WEB APPLICATION FOR MAIZE LEAF DISEASE CLASSIFICATION USING CNN
This project describes in details a web application for identifying maize leaf disease classification using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)

Dataset
The dataset used for training , testing and validating the model  is obtained  from the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smaranjitghose/corn-or-maize-leaf-disease-dataset

Model Development
The model was developed using the following technologies:

TensorFlow: Used for training the neural network.
Keras: Provided a high-level API for TensorFlow, making the model development process more intuitive.
Web Application
The web application was built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. The app allows users to upload images of maize leaves, and it predicts the disease class based on the trained CNN model.

Features
Upload Image: Users can upload an image of a maize leaf for classification.
Disease Prediction: The app predicts the disease based on the uploaded image.
Live Demo
The web app is hosted here: ttps://project-nx1y.onrender.com/.
